# River_data_scrap

The goal of this project is to pull data from internet sources to make predictions on a Potomac River gage height at Little Falls River Gage by Potomac, MD.
Neural networks were trained on historical data from up-river gages so that future predictions can be made at the Litte Falls gage at 17, 15, 8 and 4 hours in advance. It was built to be a Flask app run on PythonAnywhere.
