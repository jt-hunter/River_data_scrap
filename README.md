# River_data_scrap

This project is to demonstrate my data skills and interests.
I love being outdoors, and one of the factors in deciding if going to the river is worth while is the river's conditions.
The goal of this project is to pull relevant data from internet sources to make predicitions on a Potomac River gage height at Little Falls River Gage by Potomac, MD.
